# Discord.js Systems
This is a repository for systems that I have made. Most systems in this repository will require you to have a MongoDB database connected via the `mongoose` package. [Here is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_e6E-okvxs) to show you how to connect to a MongoDB database.

## Dependencies
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (`v16.9 or higher`)
- [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) (`npm i discord.js`)
- [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) (`npm i mongoose`)

Some projects may need some packages to work. If a certain system needs a package to work it will be written in the `README.md` file in the project folder.
